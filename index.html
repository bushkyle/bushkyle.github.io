        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am currently a sophomore studying computer science at Michigan State University.  I am currently proficient with C++, and I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.  I also have a very strong understanding of object-oriented programming.  I aspire to be a software engineer.<br><br>
        This is my website.  I really enjoy creating things, so this website serves as my portfolio.  Here you can take a look at my resume, listen to music I produced, and look at some of my graphic design work.  That's about all you need to know about me, but if you'd like to get to know me better, you can keep reading.<br><br>
        I don't have much free time as a vigilant computer science student, but when I do happen to get some time to myself, I spend it creating.  You can probably get a feel for my personality by listening to my music.  I'm a very laid-back guy.  I grew up playing video games, and I do so enjoy them.  Although I don't have any experience just yet, I will one day create my own video game or help other people create their video games.  That being said, I don't think it's any secret that I would also love to be a programmer for a video game company.  If you would like to contact me for any reason, my phone number and email address are below.</p>
